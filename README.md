# PIQ WordPress Plugin
Use the Pet Insurance Quotes plug-in to give your readers the opportunity to get free pet insurance quotes from multiple companies quickly and easily! Visitors to your site or blog provide basic data about their cat or dog and receive instant quotes from multiple providers, allowing your readers to compare offerings and pricing to find a plan that works for them and make an educated pet insurance purchase based on their specific needs.

The installed plug-in inserts a brief quote form on your page that, upon submission, will launch a results page that lists all of the available insurance providers and their offerings. Your readers wonâ€™t lose sight of your page in the process. If your readers are pet lovers, this is a great plug-in to offer.
